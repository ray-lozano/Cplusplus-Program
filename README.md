# Cplusplus-Program (AirgeadBankingApp)

#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving
The AirgeadBankingApp project has the focus on investing and compound interest. The app took the following input values from the user: Initial Investment Amount, Monthly Deposit, Annual Interest, and Number of Years. After receiving all those values the program displays two tables. The first table is the Balance and Interest Without Additional Monthly Deposits, and the second one is the Balance and Interest With Additional Monthly Deposits.

#What did you do particularly well?
The display of the menu as well as the calculations for the compound interest is what I felt that I did the best on.

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
My code could be enhanced by commpressing the amount of headers and cpp files. Currently there are too many of each file, so it may help improve efficiency by condensing them into one header and one cpp file outside of the main cpp file.

#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The void printDetails function seemed to be the most challenging due to trying to get the formatting correct for the displayed values. That one took some trial and error to finish so that the output looked as clean as possible.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I'd say the most important skills from this project that are the most important is the use of header files. Utilizing those in future programs will help keep them organized.

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The comments, spacing, and the bracket placements helped with the readability. Due to the amount of header and cpp files it has become less adaptable and maintable. Those I can go back to and clean up so that does not become an issue.
